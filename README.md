##Best Practices
Utilized Mobx for global state management
Utilized Native Base for some UI components

##Tests
I have utilized a little bit of jest in the past, but I always find myself utilizing console.log to find the data that I need and see where the break is happening. Especially in React/React Native it helps me to be able to see exactly what components have what data and where I can find the breakpoint to make sure the dataflow is working as expected.

##To Run
run ``` npm install ``` to install dependencies
then run ``` npm run ios ```
